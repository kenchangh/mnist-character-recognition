## How it works

This project is a fully self-contained MNIST handwritten-digit classifier.
All neural-network weights live **on-chip**: they are ternary ({-1, 0, +1})
and are baked into the netlist as Verilog constants, so synthesis
constant-folds them into plain logic — no RAM, no ROM macros, no weight
loading.

The network is an MLP `64 -> 32 -> 10` with binary {0,1} hidden activations
(a linear `64 -> 10` and an MLP `64 -> 16 -> 10` are selectable at synthesis
time via the `MLP` / `HIDDEN` parameters). It was trained with
quantization-aware training (straight-through estimators for the ternary
weights and binary activations) on MNIST images that were average-pooled from
28×28 to 8×8 and binarized at a fixed threshold (0.15 of full scale).
Test-set accuracy of the exact integer model (10,000 images):

| Variant | Accuracy | Cell area (yosys, sg13g2) |
|---------|----------|---------------------------|
| MLP 64→32→10 (default) | 80.3 % | ~34k µm² |
| linear 64→10 | 78.3 % | ~20k µm² |
| MLP 64→16→10 | 76.0 % | ~29k µm² |

Operation is bit-serial and takes about 24 µs per digit at 10 MHz:

1. **Load** — the host strobes START, then shifts 64 pixel bits in through
   `ui[0]`/`ui[1]` (pixel 0 = top-left, row-major, LSB first). The bits land
   in a 64-bit shift register.
2. **Layer 1** — 64 cycles: the input register rotates; each pixel bit
   add/sub/skips into 16 parallel 8-bit accumulators (the 32-hidden-unit
   default runs two 16-lane passes). Biases are preloaded so the hidden
   activation is simply the accumulator sign bit.
3. **Layer 2** — hidden bits are binarized, then fed serially (one per
   cycle) into 10 class accumulators.
4. **Argmax** — a 10-cycle sequential scan finds the best class (ties go to
   the lower digit). DONE rises; the digit appears on `uio[3:0]` and on the
   7-segment display, with the decimal point lit.

Compute starts automatically after the 64th bit; DONE rises 172 clock cycles
later (74 for the linear variant, 91 for the 16-hidden MLP). A new START
strobe — or a hardware reset — cleanly abandons any load or result in
progress.

## How to test

Serial protocol on `ui_in` (all signals sampled on the rising edge of `clk`;
`clk` may run continuously, up to 10 MHz):

* `ui[0]` **DATA** — pixel bit
* `ui[1]` **SHIFT_EN** — when high, DATA is shifted in on this clock edge
* `ui[2]` **START** — one-cycle strobe: clear the bit counter, begin a new image

```

                     bit0  bit1        bit2  ... gaps are fine:
                                             DATA only sampled when SHIFT_EN=1
```

After the 64th bit the chip computes on its own; poll DONE (`uio[4]` or
`uo[7]`). DONE stays high, and the digit stays valid, until the next START.

```
              ... last bit          compute (~172 cycles)
SHIFT_EN  ────────┐┌──┐
                  └┘  └─────────────────────────────────
DONE      ──────────────────────────────┌───────────────
                                        └→ read uio[3:0]
```

Outputs:

* `uio[3:0]` — predicted digit, binary 0–9 (uio pins are always outputs)
* `uio[4]` — DONE, `uio[5]` — BUSY (high while computing)
* `uo[6:0]` — 7-segment a–g (matches the TT demo board display), `uo[7]` —
  DONE / decimal point. The display is blank after reset until the first
  result.

Image preprocessing (host side): average-pool the 28×28 grayscale image to
8×8 (bin r spans rows ⌊r·28/8⌋ to ⌈(r+1)·28/8⌉−1, same for columns), then
set each pixel to 1 if its mean is greater than 0.15 (pixel range 0–1). Send
row-major, top-left pixel first. See `demo/rp2040_demo.py` in the project
repo for a ready-made MicroPython demo, and `test/test.py` for the cocotb
testbench that verified 200 MNIST images bit-exact against the training
pipeline.

To reproduce training / regenerate weights: `train/train.py` (PyTorch QAT)
then `train/gen_weights.py` (emits `src/weights.v`).

## External hardware

None required — the on-board 7-segment display shows the digit. Drive the
inputs from the TT demo board's RP2040 (see `demo/rp2040_demo.py`) or any
microcontroller.
